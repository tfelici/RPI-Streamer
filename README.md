sudo journalctl -u ups-monitor -f

# Test UPS integration
python3 -c "
from x120x import X120X
with X120X() as ups:
    print(ups.get_status())
"
```

## USB Storage Support

The RPI Streamer automatically detects and uses USB storage devices for saving recording segments:

### Automatic Detection
- **Multiple detection methods**: Uses `lsblk`, `/dev` scanning, and `udevadm` for reliable USB device detection
- **Auto-mounting**: Automatically mounts detected USB storage with proper permissions
- **Filesystem support**: Supports FAT32, exFAT, NTFS, ext4, ext3, and ext2 filesystems
- **Fallback options**: If auto-detection fails, tries common filesystem types

### Recording Storage
- **USB priority**: Recording segments are automatically saved to USB storage when available
- **Local fallback**: Falls back to local storage if no USB device is detected
- **Auto-cleanup**: USB devices are safely unmounted when the script exits
- **Directory structure**: Creates `streamerData/recordings/<stream_name>/` on USB devices

### Testing USB Detection
Test the USB detection functionality without running recordings:

```sh
cd ~/flask_app
python3 test_usb_detection.py
```

This will show:
- Detected USB devices and their filesystems
- Currently mounted USB devices
- Mount points and write permissions

### Manual USB Management
If needed, you can manually mount/unmount USB devices:

```sh
# List all block devices
lsblk

# Manually mount a USB device
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/usb_sdb1
sudo mount -t auto -o uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=022 /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb_sdb1

# Unmount when done
sudo umount /mnt/usb_sdb1
```

- **Flexible Domain Configuration**: Domain settings start empty, allowing configuration for any flight tracking platform or custom server
- **Hostname-Based Identification**: Each device automatically uses its system hostname for network identification

### Default Settings Structure
New devices are initialized with comprehensive default settings including:
- **Streaming Configuration**: Resolution (1280x720), framerate (30fps), bitrate (768kbps)
- **Audio Settings**: Sample rate (16kHz), bitrate (16k), volume (100%)
- **GPS Tracking**: Manual start mode, platform integration disabled by default
- **WiFi Management**: Client mode default with hostname-based hotspot fallback
- **Hardware Settings**: Auto-detection for video/audio inputs and USB storage

### Multi-Device Deployment
